## **neoFocus**

NeoFocus is a browser extention which helps you complete your day to day goals by setting up your Focus for the day. On every new tab open, neoFocus will display your focus of the day, an appealing background, time and weather in sync & a motivational quote to get you going! 

## Features 

1. User Onboarding with a Welcome Message
2. Displaying Time, current weather in sync
3. Wallpaper & quote change on every refresh

As the time progresses, I plan to implement functionality like a to-do bar & also bring improvements to the current functionalities to make your online experience easier, and more productive.
